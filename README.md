# Apex Buggy Website

## General Info
I created a responsive website for CMU's Apex Buggy team after realizing the team's current website was severely outdated. My goal was to create a coherent brand and have all the essential information easily accessible for Fall Recruitment. 

## Technologies
This project was created with:
* React
* Tailwind CSS

I created Figma [wireframes](https://www.figma.com/proto/xx6icCEqbSdchz9D0dXzTv/Apex-Website?node-id=1-2&p=f&t=orknNAWquwQh2148-0&scaling=scale-down-width&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=1%3A2) for the website's design. 

## View
